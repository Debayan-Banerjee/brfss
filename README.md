Insights from health and behavior data from the CDC

###BRFSS Introduction

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) captures information on American health-related behaviors and risk factors. It is an annual telephone survey comprised of over 400,000 adult interviews from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and three territories. It is the largest and longest running health survey system in the world, with data avaiable 1984-2014. For more information, see [CDC: BRFSS](http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/).

The BRFSS is a rich source of information on how demographics, behaviors, and other risk factors can correlate with health. It is the source of the CDC's "Healthy Days" measurement, a key performance metric for the healthcare industry. This repository will be built over time to demonstrate various correlations and conclusions that can be drawn from this data set using machine learning and statistical techniques.

To download BRFSS data, visit the [BRFSS Annual Survey Data](http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm) page, where you can find links to each year the survey has been conducted. The data is available in `.XPT` (SAS Transport Format) or in `.ASCII` files. The codebooks are also available for 1990-2014.
